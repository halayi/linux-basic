The Linux Operating System is made up of distributions like Debian, Cent OS, Fedroa, Linux Mint and Ubuntu.
Linux systems are by far one of the most secure operating systems but there is no such thing as an absolutely secure system.
The Linux system distributions are growing in popularity which also means growing exploits.

The security of any given system starts with the user. Every user of a system has a unique identifier that is known like a 
User ID which identifies a particular individual. To access the system a password is required which authenticates that it
who you claim to be, that is something only you know. The password is never to be shared at any given time to avoid being
compromised. When the authentication is done, the user gets the authorization to use the system. Every user is authorized 
access in the system up to the limit provided.

Installation of an anti virus should not be dismissed. It's true, Linux systems are far more secure than other operating
systems but it's better not to take any chances. There are various anti virus software some free and others commercial.
