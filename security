The Linux Operating System is made up of distributions like Debian, Cent OS, Fedroa, Linux Mint and Ubuntu.
Linux systems are by far one of the most secure operating systems but there is no such thing as an absolutely secure system.
The Linux system distributions are growing in popularity which also means growing exploits.

The security of any given system starts with the user. Every user of a system has a unique identifier that is known like a 
User ID which identifies a particular individual. To access the system a password is required which authenticates that it
who you claim to be, that is something only you know. The password is never to be shared at any given time to avoid being
compromised. When the authentication is done, the user gets the authorization to use the system. Every user is authorized 
access in the system up to the limit provided.

Installation of an anti virus should not be dismissed. It's true, Linux systems are far more secure than other operating
systems but it's better not to take any chances. The anti virus wards off malicious attacks especially when connected to 
the internet keeping your computer running effectively at the same time safeguarding your identity and personal information.
There are various anti virus software some free and others commercial.

As long as software is being actively supported by the vendor, there will always be updates. These are patches that add new
features, fix bugs and close security holes. Operating system updates are important to install because when the vendors
launch their software it's not 100% error free and also technology keeps changing all the time. The most convenient way to 
update your system without having such a task interrupt your work is by simply automating the updates.
